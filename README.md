## E-Commerce

This is an online  shop system or also known as an e-commerce that is written mostly in Node.js which is a JavaScript  code. The system has the basic ability of a common e-commerce website such as hashing password, login, register, display items and users, update items and users, delete and add to cart function.   



## Installation

First, you must install all the npm packages listed in the json file named package-lock.json. You can either install the packages individually or just simply type "npm intall" to automatically install all required packages.  But take notes, that this particular code is only the backend of the system which it currently doesn't have a user interface to interact with. To interact with the system, you must use a program called "Postman" to see the full ability of the system.



Install all packages automatically.

```bash
npm install
```

Installing the packages individually.

```bash
npm install --save bcrypt
npm install --save body-parser
npm install --save dotenv
npm install --save express
npm install --save jsonwebtoken
npm install --save mongoose
```



## How to use

To use the program, you need to use the local host port number of 8800.
